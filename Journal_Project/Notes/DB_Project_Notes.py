## Project Idea: College Note Taking App

for rich editor refer to https://dev.to/giasuddin90/how-to-add-a-custom-rich-text-editor-in-your-django-website-51g5

Here's a breakdown of your project idea with Django code snippets to get you started:

**App Functionalities:**

* Windows App (Frontend): Takes notes for various college categories (notes, homework, assignments, projects).
* Django Website (Backend): Handles user authentication, stores notes in a database (not SQLite3 for production), and provides an API for the Windows app to interact with.

**Django Code Snippets:**

**1. Models.py (Define Database Structure):**

```python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from ckeditor.fields import RichTextField

class Note(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)  # Link notes to user
    category = models.CharField(max_length=50, choices=(  # Choices for note categories
        ("Note", "Note"),
        ("Homework", "Homework"),
        ("Assignment", "Assignment"),
        ("Project", "Project"),
    ))
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    content = RichTextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)  # Auto-record creation date

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.user.username} - {self.category}: {self.title}"
```

**2. Views.py (Handle API Requests):**

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import JsonResponse
from .models import Note
from ckeditor.widgets import CKEditorWidget

def create_note(request):
    //use ckeditor widget.
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Get note data from request (data format depends on Windows app)
        data = request.POST  # Example: data['category'], data['title'], data['content']
        user = request.user  # Get currently logged-in user
        new_note = Note.objects.create(user=user, category=data['category'], title=data['title'], content=data['content'])
        return JsonResponse({'message': 'Note created successfully!', 'note': new_note.id})  # Send success response with note ID
    else:
        return JsonResponse({'error': 'Invalid request method'})

# Other views for potential functionalities (update notes, retrieve notes etc.)
```

**3. urls.py (Define API Endpoints):**

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('create-note/', views.create_note, name='create_note'),
    # Add other URL patterns for different functionalities
]
```

**4. Settings.py (Configurations):**

* Configure a production-ready database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) instead of SQLite3.
* Set `AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'your_app.User'` if using a custom user model.
* Consider using libraries like Django REST Framework for a more robust API.

**5. Account Authentication:**

* Use Django's built-in user authentication system or integrate a third-party service like OAuth.

**6. Hiding Admin Page:**

* There are several ways to hide the admin page. Here's a simple approach:

    * In `urls.py`, comment out the line `from django.contrib.admin.urls import admin_site`
    * Manually remove the admin path from `ROOT_URLCONF` in `settings.py`.

**Note:** This is a basic example. You'll need to implement additional functionalities like user registration, login, managing notes (edit, delete), and proper error handling. 

**Windows App Development:**

* You can use various frameworks like PyQt, Kivy, or develop a native Windows app using C#.
* The app will need to connect to your Django API using libraries/frameworks like requests to send and receive data.

**Remember:** This is a starting point. Research and explore relevant libraries and frameworks to enhance your application's features and security. Consider using secure communication protocols (HTTPS) for data transmission.
